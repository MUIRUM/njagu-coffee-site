    <h2>Our Farm to Cup process</h2>
    <p>1.Harvesting and Washing 
        <br>
        <br>
        The journey begins with harvesting coffee cherries-bright red or yellow fruits from the coffee
        plant. Each cherry typically contains two seeds, which we know as coffee beans. After
        harvesting, farmers deliver cherries to a washing station or FACTORY where they undergo
        de-pulping. This process removes the outer skin and pulp, revealing seeds covered in sticky
        mucilage.
        <br>
        <br>
        This mucilage is removed through fermentation, washing, or mechanical scrubbing. This leaves
        the coffee in its "parchment state" (also called pergamino), with beans enclosed in a thin,
        papery endocarp. This stage critically determines final quality-if poorly executed (for example,if coffee is over-fermented or beans are nipped), it can destroy the quality of even perfectlygrown coffee.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Drying Process
        The parchment coffee then undergoes drying to reduce moisture content from approximately
        60% to around 10-12%. This process happens at the farm for large estates or at coffee washing
        stations (FACTORIES) for cooperatives.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Milling and Grading
        Once properly dried, the coffee is delivered to a DRY MILL where the parchment layer is
        removed through hulling, revealing the green coffee beans inside. At this stage, processors
        grade coffee based on bean sizes-AA being the best, followed by AB, and so on down to T.
        Coffee traders buys and sells these green beans on the global market or trades them at
        exchanges like the Nairobi Coffee Exchange. 
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Cupping
        A sample of 1 kg is drawn per each grade and taken to coffee sample for analysis in the categories
        <br>
        > Raw: this is fresh green coffee where the size, colur, and physical characteristics are clearly analyzed defects I identified
        <br>
        > Roast: coffee is roasted by sample roaster; Centre cuts analyzed, quality and body. 
        <br>
        > Cup: the, as the coffee cools, continue to assess its acidity, body, balance, sweetness, uniformity, and cleanliness. Each of these attributes contributes to the overall score
        and perception of the coffee
        <br>
        > To conclude the cupping session with a comprehensive score. 
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Detail: Tally up your scores on the evaluation sheet to determine the coffee's overall quality. This final score helps in making informed decisions about coffee selection for your shop or personal enjoyment.
