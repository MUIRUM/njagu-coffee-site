      <h1>Welcome to Njagu Coffee</h1>
      <p>Celebrating generations of Kenyan coffee excellence.</p>
      
      <p> Since the introduction of coffee in Kenya in 1893,a remarkable journey unfolded in our community. 
        A generation was born into the coffee culture nutured within its embrace, and honed the craft of cultivating the perfect coffee berry using the organic resources at their disposal.
    <br>
    <br>
    
     This generation, who are now our beloved elders, have dedicated their lives to mastering the art of coffee farming. 
     Their diligent work has allowed them to cultivate coffee that stands as a testament to their unwavering commitment to quality. They have passed down the art of coffee cultivation, generation to generation, instilling the wisdom of the soil,seasons and nuances of each coffee plant. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As they age gracefully, it is our duty to recognise their lifelong dedication and to honor their contribution. 
    It is time to uplift their lives by paying a premium price for the coffee they so meticulously grow, thus investing not only in the quality but also in the dignity of these remarkable individuals. 
    <br> 
    <br>
     Njagu coffee owes its exeptional quality to these resilient and experienced farmers who rely solely on the proceeds of this coffee.
     By purchasing their coffee at a premium, we are not just supporting their livelihoods but also recognising the invaluable heritage they have bestowed upon us. 
    <br> 
    <br>
    In addition to their individual efforts, these remarkable farmers have joined hands to create a community-based organisation to oversee their welfare,ensuring that they remain united in the pursuit of a better life and that their legacy continues. 
    Njagu coffee is not just about a cup of coffee; but about a tradition, a legacy and a remarkable journey of an entire community. It has and always will be about nuturing an art that has been perfected over decadesand celebrating the dedication of those who made it possible.
    It is our honour and privilege to be a part of this legacy and we are committed to ensuring that it continues to thrive. </p>
